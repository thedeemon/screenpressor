                          ScreenPressor 4.2

1. What is it?

ScreenPressor is a video codec designed specifically for screen capture.
It is lossless which means it keeps 100% quality keeping all your text
and graphics crystal clear. It provides very good compression on typical
screen capture content (windows, text and simple graphics) but not so good
on photos and natural video.

2. How to install it?

For 32-bit (x86) version you can either run ScreenPressor4_x86install.exe
or open the x86_version folder, right click on file scpr.inf 
and choose Install.

For 64-bit (x64) version open the x64_version folder, right click
on file scpr64.inf and choose Install.


3. How to run it?

Like other codecs, ScreenPressor is not a standalone application which
you can run from menu or desktop icon. Rather it is a component used by
video capture and editing applications and players to compress and decompress
your video. To capture screen with ScreenPressor you'll need a video capture
app like CamStudio, Camtasia or WinCAM. To recompress already existing video
with ScreenPressor you'll need a video editing app like VirtualDub or Video
Enhancer. To play video compressed with ScreenPressor you may use virtually
any video player in Windows.

4. How to configure it?

When using ScreenPressor in a video capture or editing application select
ScreenPressor from the list of codecs and press Configure button (which is
usually present in most codec selection dialogs). You can also configure
ScreenPressor by running spconfig.exe from ScreenPressor folder.
